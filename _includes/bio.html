		20+ years of experience as a software engineer,
		manager, and business leader. 
		I founded and sold two startups (BillMonk, Precision Polling),
		and built two business units from scratch in 
		rapid-growth startups (Audience at SurveyMonkey grew to a $20+ million ARR business;
		and Marketplace at VTS was the fastest-growing product in proptech history).
		</p>
	      <p>
		I'm here to help software startups get off the ground.
		I enjoy growing teams, coaching engineers and leaders,
		and collaborating to find solutions to real-world problems.

					Our customer had developed a framework for assessing and benchmarking corporate
					disability inclusivity, but needed help turning this into a product vision that
					would scale. Chuck worked directly with me to run a kickoff workshop with stakeholders,
					then to develop a prototype and a report with recommendations. He not only
						addressed technical considerations but also corporate engagement
					models and a multi-year rollout strategy. The collaboration couldn't have gone better,
					and the result set everyone up for success.

						I'm really glad we worked with Chuck. He helped coach a first-time engineering manager

						Our first project, to evaluate our technical architecture roadmap, was so helpful that we extended Chuck's engagement to get his input on our hiring process, and also how to structure a platform engineering team as we continue to grow. He worked with leadership, managers, and engineers 1:1 to share his extensive experience and perspective, which let us move quickly and confidently.
