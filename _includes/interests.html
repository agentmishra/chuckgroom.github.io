			My personal interests include:
			<ul>
			    <li>
				<b>Deep learning</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. I'm working through several online classes, and swap articles with collegues.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<b>Rapid physical prototyping</b>. I have a <a href="https://medium.com/@cgroom/glowforge-first-thoughts-and-impressions-8793b2eb9d5">Glowforge laser cutter</a> (I was a minor angel investor) and I'm obsessed by the
				potential of in-home precision tooling.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<b>Creating things in general.</b> I've always been into woodworking, gardening, software, and hardware; I'm constantly
				seeking out new projects.
