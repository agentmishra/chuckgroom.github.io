	      <p>
		I offer three different models for working with companies.
	      </p>
	      <ul>
		<li><b>Advisorship</b>: a long-term relationship. We will meet for a few hours a month
		  to discuss current challenges and strategy.</li>
		<li><b>Consulting CTO</b>: a project-based engagement for a particular problem or task.
		  I have extensive experience helping teams with their recruiting pipeline and process,
		  as well as design, coding, and due dilligence projects.
		</li>
		<li><b>Fractional CTO</b>: ongoing tasks need support
		  right away. A team may not yet need a
		  full-time CTO or cannot wait for a full-time hire.
		  Often, this role includes helping to hire a
		  replacement or to identifying ways to fill the gaps.
		</li>
